Cozy Bedroom w Patio in a 4-BR Artist&apos;s HOUSE in POTRERO HILL","price":"$450","text":" greetings! cute room in a 4 bedroom house available in potrero hill before reading any further please note that this is for a temporary 25 months rental term only ok so i am an artist dj electronic music producer and tech developer this house is an internationally known hub that has seen many artists from all around the world pass through when they come to perform here in the bay area this is house is probably the last stronghold of what san francisco use to be when it was once a haven for artists a lot of amazing art music and ideas were created here and of course a lot of good times have been had too! : to be honest i'm really only looking for those who exude the same kind of vibe if you're someone who's super anal about clutters and noise and people hanging out at night not often at all but happens and you're cool to have non-shady friends over as well then this is not for you i am a dj and music producer and my studio is basically the dining area; so while i am considerate about volume levels at night i do often stay up all night cranking away at my music again if complete silence is something you can't live with then this arrangement will not work for you also this is a &quot;people friendly&quot; house so there will be times when friends or visiting artists end up crashing on the coach your friends of course are welcome too just as long if they're people you know for a while and cool and not some shady junkie tinder one-offs well you get the idea i can attest that in the 10 years of living here everyone that passed through and floated here has been amazing beautiful individuals and that includes you!    about the room: it isn't big but it's cozy and yields high marginal utility shelves on one side and a large closet in the back futon on floor desk with two monitors chairs you have your own patio too that leads to the backyard which could use some tlc but

where we each take a directorship and are responsible for something i am writing this advert sitting next to the director of bikes and the director of outdoor activities for example     a lot of us used to live in the south bay but moved into the house in order to benefit from the great food great music and the great culture that sf has to offer the proximity of the caltrain makes the commute painless     the housemates are all in tech not surprisingly but this isn't a criteria for the house we are interested in new people from any profession who seeks fun and is interested in truly living in the city more importantly we want someone who can get along with everyone in house and someone who is going to be an active participant in the house rather than someone who uses it as a base    as far as amenities go we are spread over 5 floors 3 for rooms 1 for communal living/social/kitchen space and 1 basement with a co-working space and cinema room there's a games room too its very open

-Need Awesome, Fun, Roomie to fill the Big Room in my 2br","price":"$1200","lat":"37.772500","lon":"-122.414700","text":" this was my original posting and i've added some stuff below it to help facilitate this process:    sooooooo who do you know that's rad extroverted knows their way around the city has cool friends and wants to live with the best roomie ever? because that's me and i need a roomie stat  :  to make a short story long my roomie had some family issues come up and had to move out suddenly as a result my financial cushion has been significantly diminished and i need to find a new roomie truth be told you could move in whenever you want but i need a check for your half of the rent as if you moved in sep 1 clearly far from an ideal situation but it is what it is so here's the deal:  - i live at 7th and folsom in one of the best areas of the city   - it's literally 3 blocks off the highway and 3 blocks from bart  - street parking  - walking distance from almost every music venue as well as all that soma has to offer   - the place isn't brand new  but it's no frat house by any means it could use some new carpets and a paint job this baby has seen a few late nights but if you also happen to have some nice furniture or would like to throw down with me in the near future to make it look sweeter   lets do it     about me =  i've been told by former roomies that i'm the &quot;easiest person they've ever lived with&quot; i'm 34 years old i'm not obnoxious give high fives or fist pump at the bar when i get drunk i&quot;m responsible very well educated and like to party sometimes till late on the weekends occasionally on week days but that's far less often since i'm gettin old there will absolutely be some late nights with people over you don't necessarily have to partake - but you've gotta be cool with it going on that's all  also i'm also an east coaster so if you're easily offended or don't enjoy the witty profane ball-busting banter - don't even bother e mailing me you're gonna hate me within 5 min    lastly i have rent control so i feel like i'd be kind of an ass if i charged the going rate for the room   the rent - is officially too damn high!  so i'm only charging $1200 which for this area is robbery    but wait there's more!!  since i'm feeling so generous today - i'll even throw in the existing roommate   i'm looking for a long term roomie but you don't have to sign a lease or anything     oh yeah and you don't need first and last just $400 security deposit that if you live here for longer than a year - assume you're not getting that back just being honest    updates:   -  i'm also very much a single guy and loving it  so it doesnt' matter whether or not you are - but if you're a cool cat who knows how to play a good wingman or wingwoman and/or happen to have a broad social network - that would be awesome  i'm basically an extreme extrovert so if you're the quiet type - chances are you're gonna hate me i'm looking to meet someone i'll be good friends with aside from someone that's just gonna pay rent every month  lets unite the clans ya?     -  when you reply can you please include some social media links or something? at least send me something i can use to get a better idea of who you are?  here's my fb:  https://wwwfacebookcom/sffatkid   - and while this may seem odd - you'll likely be able to get a good grasp of my sense of humor likes/dislikes etc by checking out my okc profile so here ya go:  https://wwwokcupidcom/profile/gmoneysf    when replying back to me try  in your own way to answer this:  who are you? what did you notice in my profile that makes you think we'd be homies?  and what can you bring to the table aside from a rent check every month?    lastly lastly - just to clarify - this is a 2br

all of that as is    about us: i'm a 25-year-old guy and work in ad-tech sales so basically like everyone else who has written an ad very into music photography traveling and hiking the other roommate is my 27-year-old buddy from college with very similar interests and one of the nicest guys i know couple caveats here: this is a split home so the living room is going to look like a living room but will have a curtain a desk and a daybed/couch that jimmy will be sleeping on we're both really clean guys and don't bring the party home so it won't kill the vibe that much and the curtain will be open at all times unless jimmy needs privacy or is sleeping the other caveat is that i have a year-old-dog named franklin who is adorable pictured but unfortunately if you're allergic it's best if you look elsewhere     if that sounds good please send me your linkedin insta handle and more about yourself feel free to text this info i will send you back info on how to check out the space as we move

dish washer it's located right off the corner of 17th and valencia tucked away on a slightly quieter street so it's steps away from a ton of great restaurants bars and shops and we're only a five minute walk away from dolores park the 16th and mission bart station is about 2 blocks away and there are several muni stops nearby as well overall we think this is one of the best locations in sf!    the room itself is a decent size about 12'x12' and includes hardwood floors a closet and a window it is also a private room that is separated down the hall from the other 2 rooms please make sure to check out the pictures included in this post!     we are looking for someone to move in on saturday october 1st the first month's rent will be due upon selection of the offer beginning on november 1st rent will be due on the first of each month at the full rent amount of $1450 we also split costs for utilities + laundry rental + internet at approximately $50/person lastly you will need to buy our current roommate out of her $1690 security deposit at move in    the roommates:    ray 26 works in advertising and lives a life very similar to that of don draper well not quite but he does enjoy a good drink and a good advertisement he is also very passionate about sports and you can many times find him watching baseball games at at t park or tearing up the soccer field in fifa additionally he

a michigan grad who is excited about recently moving to san francisco he enjoys riding his bike and exploring every nook and cranny within this historic city    what we are looking for:    we are looking for someone in their mid-20s with a stable job and an interesting personality as roommates in the city we lead busy personal lives but do enjoy hanging out occasionally after work or on the weekends we like to party but don't really like to bring the party home and we'd appreciate if our new roommate followed suit we also don't do any hard drugs and do not want a roommate that does we are ok with someone who smokes occasionally but smoking inside the building is an absolute no    the ideal roommate would be relatively clean and tidy especially in the common rooms we don't really care about your room as long as there is no odor or damage as stated earlier we don't have a dishwasher so it's each roommate's responsibility to hand wash his or her dishes we aren't super stingy about this since we typically don't use too many dishes but we don't like dishes to be left in the sink for more than a day or two     that's pretty much all we have for now if you read this whole

us were new to the city and some of us moved from other apartments we get a high volume of applications from people wanting to move in but since we want to build a community we try to be very careful with who we accept as roommates    this is what we are looking for in a roommate someone who:  - is truly respectful of others and more than willing to help when needed  - takes initiative and an active role in the house and its environment; eg fixing things organizing small events etc  - cleans up after themselves we have cleaning done three times a week but we can't have people who don't do their part if you can't be clean this house is not for you  - is interesting there's no iq test but someone who we think will be a good match for the house    the house:  we have double rooms and a few single rooms available for a higher price and a big common space where we hold events both big and small that the roommates organize such as parties lan parties learning meetups sports dinners etc

intersection of three popular/lively neighborhoods: the mission castro duboce triangle and hayes valley the apartment is within a 12-unit building in an alleyway both the building and the street are fairly quiet during the day and night     the apartment has two private bedrooms no living room a kitchen a shared bathroom and a conjoining hallway this apartment is perfect for someone who is okay with having a decent-sized space 156 ft2 but no common room/communal space however other than the bedroom the kitchen is large enough to supplement as a common space    the building has on-site laundry on the 1st floor while the apartment is located on the 2nd floor parking does not come with rent tenants and guests most depend on street parking if available you may be able to acquire a parking permit from the city for long-term parking the apartment is conveniently located 2 blocks away from 16th bart church street muni and van ness muni in all directions    no pets allowed no smoking   \t  about me:   i'm a 27 year old gay black male and working professional i've lived in san francisco for about 3 years but i'm originally from boston although my full-time work is in arts/education non-profit management i spend a lot of my time on various personal projects--i'm a dancer/choreographer actor and photographer outside of that i'm a restaurant foodie music and pop-culture enthusiast nightlife-lover hiker and traveler i have an amazing supportive and positive social network here and consider my friends family hoping to maintain that positive environment with my new roommate    my future roommate:   i'm looking for a single male roommate gay/gay-friendly who is professionally and financially stable in san francisco i need a roommate who is responsible respectful and mindful of keeping the shared spaces clean organized and stocked of supplies the apartment is meant to be a place of seclusion/retreat although the apartment is small i don't mind the hosting of guests every once-in-a-while if you are a social/nightlife person like i am the apartment is more of a place to &quot;start&quot; the night rather than &quot;end&quot; the night i'm an extroverted introvert meaning i can be pretty social but get most of my energy from being alone i'm not expecting a best friend but i hope to have a roommate that i can socialize with at times at the same time you must be okay with not having a roommate to constantly socialize with--most times when i come home from work i don't feel like talking to anyone which speaks to that introvert piece

flat in the heart of mission we are currently looking for help with rent in the form of a respectful sweet super clean community- and household- oriented people as we search for the perfect long-term situation**    d 34 has been living here since she moved to sf about 8 years ago works as a nanny and at a yoga studio and is expecting a baby in october! her partner e 31  just moved in to the flat but has lived in sf his whole life works full time and keeps busy with yoga and martial arts we're planning a home birth and are busy preparing our home and lives for the arrival our lovechild we also spend time cooking at home and tending our community garden plot    in the short term we are looking for temporary tenants that will meet the following expectations:    understand that this is a temporary sublet we are currently looking for someone to join the house for only one month in september* if it turns out to be an extremely good fit we may invite you to stay on for a longer term     *there is a very slight possibility that our home birth would happen in the last week of september and at that time we would need optimal privacy in order to let a natural birth work we would graciously ask you to stay out for 1-3 days in this unlikely case we would both reimburse your rent for those days and offer an inconvenience reparation of $100 please have real backup plans to stay elsewhere during this hypothetical short time again very unlikely but possible    note: we would be thrilled to house a doula or doula-in-training for september/october/november so that they could gain experience help with the birth postpartum and at the same time gain some experience in their own field of work if this applies we would obviously not ask you to leave and would possibly be open to negotiations on rent as a trade    pay rent: $1000 for the larger room includes internet and utilities and $1000 security deposit in cash upon move-in for a couple rent is $1400 $800 for the smaller room single person only deposit of $800 you will receive your deposit back when you've emptied and cleaned the room by your agreed-upon move-out date [for longer term tenants pay rent on time every month]     in addition to cleaning up after yourself after using a space agree to contribute an hour weekly to deep cleaning jobs in the common spaces without reminders or nagging     please be respectful of us and of the house we are cultivating a family home and in our family community we'll share things here hang out and communicate frankly about what works and doesn't work for us    in this household we usually go to sleep and wake on the early side our lease terms are that we limit noise at all times but particularly between the hours of 10pm and 8am we appreciate any peace and quiet we can get in what can be a boisterous neighborhood    for the long term the most important thing to us is that we build a cooperative community that will be nourishing for all involved particularly our baby    we are one floor up from ground level no elevator the larger room for rent is furnished with a full-sized bed and has closet access the smaller features a twin bed no closet our shared spaces include a minimally furnished living room which is useful for yoga or meditation a stocked kitchen immediate dishwashing policy in effect and a single bathroom diy home improvement projects such as painting walls and floors in the hall/stairway will be in progress this month    if you think you could realistically be a good fit for a month or more please feel free to send along a description of your current situation and longer-term goals with enough details to give us an idea of your lifestyle if it seems like it could work we'll set up a time to show you the room and get you in as soon as possible    **in the long term we'll ideally find another like-minded couple or single parent with a baby/small child to share this space and all the household responsibilities with us we would be very interested in negotiating a childcare trade situation watching each others' babies while the others have a date or go to a class matching each other hour for hour in the even
